I don't know about you, but I've already had way too much of lookin' at my ugly mug. Besides, I put some effort into selecting an appropriate (and freely licensed) image for each of my posts. So, I've made an attempt to add image metadata to my blog posts using Facebook's [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/) (also supported by LinkedIn) and Twitter's [Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards).

Honestly, I didn't study this thoroughly. I just copy/pasted some code from a tutorial, but I've done some minimal testing and it looks like it's working. Social Media integration is a valuable skill in Web Development, so I expect to revisit this topic, just not right now.
